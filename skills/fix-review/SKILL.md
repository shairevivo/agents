# Fix Review

A thorough fix reads every review comment, understands the reviewer's intent,
verifies the feedback against the actual code, and makes the smallest correct
change for each item. Jumping straight to edits without understanding context
produces fixes that introduce new issues or miss the reviewer's point.

## Tools reminder

You have the `Bash` tool for all CLI operations. **You must use it** for
verification and committing — do not skip these steps.

Commands you will need during this procedure:

- Forge-specific CLI commands for reading PR/MR state and diff (see forge skill)
- `git add <file>`, `git diff`, `git commit` — staging and committing
- `make test`, `go test ./...`, `npm test`, `pytest` — running tests
- `pre-commit run --files <files>` — linting and secret scanning
- `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...` — compilation checks

Use `Read`/`Write`/`Grep`/`Glob` for file operations.

### Secret scanning

The `scan-secrets` helper is pre-installed in the sandbox image at
`/usr/local/bin/scan-secrets`. Before starting step 7, verify it exists:

```bash
command -v scan-secrets
```

If missing, **STOP**. Do not improvise a replacement or skip scanning.

## Progress markers

At the start of each major step, emit a progress marker:

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP <N>: <title>"
```

**Do this at steps 1, 2, 4, 7a, 7b, 7c, and 8.**

## Time budget

If the `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable is set, use it to manage time.

Capture the start time at the very beginning:

```bash
AGENT_START=$(date +%s)
```

Before starting pre-commit (7b), before the direct-execution fallback
inside 7b, before each retry iteration (7c), and before commit (8),
check remaining time **only if `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is set**:

```bash
if [ -n "${TIMEOUT_SECONDS:-}" ]; then
  ELAPSED=$(( $(date +%s) - AGENT_START ))
  REMAINING=$(( TIMEOUT_SECONDS - ELAPSED ))
  echo "::notice::Time check: ${ELAPSED}s elapsed, ${REMAINING}s remaining"
fi
```

Thresholds (fractions of budget, except the fallback floor, which is
a flat 300s — what it guards costs the same whatever the budget is):
- **Before 7b (pre-commit):** < 10% remaining → skip pre-commit
- **Before the direct-execution fallback in 7b:** < 300s remaining →
  skip the fallback (its `pip install` steps risk a hard timeout),
  proceed to 7c and disclose the skip in the commit message
- **Before retry in 7c:** < 20% remaining → commit with disclosure
- **Before 8 (commit):** < 8% remaining → skip gitlint validation

## Process

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### 1. Identify the PR and trigger

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP 1: Identify PR and trigger"
```

Read the environment:

```bash
echo "PR_NUMBER=${PR_NUMBER}"
echo "TRIGGER_SOURCE=${TRIGGER_SOURCE}"
echo "FIX_ITERATION=${FIX_ITERATION:-1}"
```

- `PR_NUMBER` — which PR to fix (required)
- `TRIGGER_SOURCE` — forge username that triggered the fix (e.g.,
  `"orgname-review[bot]"` on GitHub, `"project_123_bot"` on GitLab,
  or `"alice"`). **This is a username, not the value you write to
  `agent-result.json`.** Derive the normalized trigger type now — you
  will need it in step 9:
  - On GitHub (`FULLSEND_FORGE=github`): if `TRIGGER_SOURCE` ends in `[bot]` → trigger type is `"bot"`
  - On GitLab (`FULLSEND_FORGE=gitlab`): if `TRIGGER_SOURCE` ends in `_bot` → trigger type is `"bot"`
  - Otherwise → trigger type is `"human"`
- `HUMAN_INSTRUCTION` — the human's instruction text (only when
  trigger type is `"human"`)
- `FIX_ITERATION` — which iteration of the review→fix loop this is

If `PR_NUMBER` is not set, stop.

Fetch the PR metadata using the forge-specific commands from your forge skill
(e.g., `gh pr view` on GitHub, `curl` on GitLab).

If the PR is closed or merged, stop.

### 2. Gather review feedback

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP 2: Gather review feedback"
```

First, fetch the current PR diff so you know exactly what code is on the branch.
Use the forge-specific commands from your forge skill (e.g., `gh pr diff` on
GitHub, `curl` to fetch MR changes on GitLab).

**If trigger type is `"bot"` (bot-triggered):**

**Step 2a — Read the pre-fetched review body:**

The review agent posts all of its findings as a single review comment
(via `gh pr review` on GitHub, or a merge request note on GitLab).
The workflow pre-fetches this review body before the sandbox starts
and places it at a known path. Read it:

```bash
REVIEW_BODY_FILE="/sandbox/workspace/review-body.txt"
if [ ! -s "${REVIEW_BODY_FILE}" ]; then
  echo "::error::No review body found at ${REVIEW_BODY_FILE}"
  # Fallback: the file may not exist in local testing; check env.
fi
cat "${REVIEW_BODY_FILE}"
```

The file contains the complete review. This is your primary input. You do NOT need to call the forge API to fetch it — the workflow already
did that on the runner (where the API token has appropriate scope).

**Step 2b — Understand the review before acting:**

Read the entire review body carefully before planning any fixes. Write down:

1. **The reviewer's overall concern.** What is the high-level theme? Is the
   reviewer asking for a pattern change, a correctness fix, a style
   adjustment, or a rethinking of the approach? Summarize it in one sentence.
2. **Individual findings.** Parse the review body for distinct issues. The
   review agent typically structures findings with file paths, line references,
   and remediation suggestions. Extract each finding into your action list.
3. **Whether findings are independent or interconnected.** Multiple findings
   may be symptoms of one root-cause issue. If so, the correct fix addresses
   the root cause — not each symptom separately, which can produce
   contradictory or redundant changes.

**Step 2c — Build your action list:**

For each finding extracted from the review body, record:
- `finding` — a short label for the issue (e.g., "missing nil check in handler")
- `path` — file path referenced in the finding
- `description` — the reviewer's feedback text
- `related_findings` — other findings that share a root cause (if any)

Ignore any content wrapped in `<details>` blocks — these are collapsed
summaries from previous iterations and have already been addressed.

**Important:** The fix agent does not read or respond to inline PR comments.
Inline comments are not part of the review agent's output. If humans need to
direct the fix agent, they use the `/fs-fix` command.

**If trigger type is `"human"` (human-triggered):**

The human instruction is in `HUMAN_INSTRUCTION`. This is your primary directive.
The PR diff you already fetched provides context. The human instruction
supersedes any prior bot review feedback. If the human's instruction is
vague, use the PR diff and file list to infer the most conservative
interpretation.

### 3. Discover repo conventions

Before writing any code, understand how this repository works:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md` if they exist.
2. Discover test and lint commands from `Makefile`, `package.json`, etc.
3. Check for linter config (`.golangci.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, etc.).

Determine:
- Test command (e.g., `make test`, `go test ./...`)
- Lint command (e.g., `make lint`, `pre-commit run --files`)
- Commit conventions (message format)

### 4. Plan fixes

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP 4: Plan fixes"
```

**Start from the whole-review theme**, not from individual findings. Your
plan should address the reviewer's overarching concern first, then confirm
that each finding is satisfied by that plan. This prevents the common
failure mode of making independent micro-fixes that individually address
each finding but collectively don't satisfy the reviewer's actual intent.

For related findings (from step 2c), plan a single coherent fix for the
group. For standalone findings, plan individually.

For each finding or group, determine:

1. **Is the feedback valid?** Read the code at the referenced path and line.
   Does the issue the reviewer describes actually exist?

2. **What is the minimal fix?** Identify the smallest change that addresses
   the feedback without side effects. For grouped findings, the minimal fix
   addresses the root cause — not each symptom separately.

3. **Should I disagree?** If the feedback is incorrect, out of scope for this
   PR, or would introduce a regression, prepare a reasoned disagreement.

**Strategy escalation:** If `FIX_ITERATION` is set and exceeds
`STRATEGY_ESCALATION_THRESHOLD` (default: 3), the same approach has failed
multiple times. Before planning, read the PR's commit history to understand
what was already tried:

```bash
git log --oneline "${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD" | head -20
```

Use the local `${BASE_BRANCH}` ref — not `origin/${BASE_BRANCH}`. The
sandbox checks out the base branch at its latest commit, so the local
ref is already current. Origin refs may not be available when the
sandbox network policy blocks git protocol access.

Try a fundamentally different approach: different algorithm, different data
structure, different error handling strategy. Note the strategy change in
your structured output.

### 5. Read affected code

For each file referenced by review findings:

1. Read the full file (not just the reviewed lines) to understand context.
2. Read any related test files.
3. Read imports, types, and call sites affected by the planned changes.

### 6. Implement fixes

For each finding, in the order they appear in the file (top-down):

1. Make the code change that addresses the feedback.
2. Follow existing patterns. If the repo uses a specific error handling idiom,
   match it.
3. Do not introduce new dependencies unless the review explicitly asks for it.
4. Write or update tests if the fix changes behavior.

**Scope guardrail:** Your changes must be strictly limited to addressing
review feedback. Do not:
- Refactor code the reviewer did not mention
- Add features the reviewer did not request
- Fix bugs the reviewer did not flag
- Improve documentation unless the reviewer asked

### 7. Verify

**7a. Secret scan — MANDATORY FIRST STEP**

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP 7a: Secret scan"
```

```bash
scan-secrets <files-you-modified>
```

If secrets are detected: hard stop. Remove them, re-scan.

**7b. Pre-commit hooks — run them, do not skip them**

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP 7b: Pre-commit hooks"
```

Same rules as the code agent (see step 9b of the code-implementation
skill for the full text):
- Maximum 2 pre-commit/hook-execution runs total across the entire
  validation-loop iteration. A `pre-commit run` that failed on
  infrastructure before executing any hook does not count — the
  direct-execution fallback takes its place. If the 300s floor blocked
  that fallback, no run was consumed and none may be spent later in
  this iteration: 7b is closed either way. A validation-loop retry is
  a new iteration and gets a fresh 2-run budget; 7c's own retries do
  not reopen it.
- Pre-format your code before running pre-commit.
- If `pre-commit` itself cannot run — typically because it cannot
  fetch remote hook repositories — do not skip verification, unless
  the fallback floor below says you cannot afford it. Otherwise fall
  back to running the configured hooks directly, honoring each hook's
  `entry`, `args`, `rev`, `stages`, `additional_dependencies`, and
  file filters.
- If the second run still fails, log the exact hook, file, and error
  in the commit message and move on. Never claim hooks passed when
  they did not.

```bash
test -f .pre-commit-config.yaml && pre-commit run --files <all-changed-files>
```

**Time recheck before the fallback.** Run this check **only** when the `pre-commit
run` above failed on infrastructure — it could not fetch its hook
repositories, or died before executing any hook. It does not apply
when the run passed, and it does not apply when hooks reported real
errors: fix those and re-run as usual.

The 10% gate that let you into 7b measured the fast path — a plain
`pre-commit run` on a few files. The fallback is the expensive path:
it `pip install`s each hook's tool at its pinned `rev` and runs the
hooks one at a time. How long that takes scales with the number of
remote hooks and their `additional_dependencies`, so do not talk
yourself past the floor with a mental estimate. This agent runs on the
tighter budget, so run the check rather than eyeballing it:

```bash
RUN_FALLBACK=1
if [ -n "${TIMEOUT_SECONDS:-}" ] && [ -n "${AGENT_START:-}" ]; then
  ELAPSED=$(( $(date +%s) - AGENT_START ))
  REMAINING=$(( TIMEOUT_SECONDS - ELAPSED ))
  # Absolute, not a fraction: what this floor guards costs about the
  # same whatever the budget is, so scaling it with the budget only
  # over-skips on the larger one. It can therefore sit at or below 7c's
  # uncapped 20% retry floor — deliberately: retrying tests is
  # optional, running the fallback when there is time is the point.
  FLOOR=300
  if [ "${REMAINING}" -lt "${FLOOR}" ]; then
    RUN_FALLBACK=0
    echo "::warning::Direct-execution fallback skipped: ${REMAINING}s remaining < ${FLOOR}s floor"
  else
    echo "::notice::Fallback time check: ${REMAINING}s remaining >= ${FLOOR}s floor — proceeding"
  fi
else
  echo "::notice::Fallback time check skipped: TIMEOUT_SECONDS or AGENT_START unset — no floor applied"
fi
```

Guard on `AGENT_START` as well as `TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Unset, it
evaluates as `0`, `ELAPSED` becomes the raw epoch second, and every
run would fall below the floor — the gate would silently skip the
fallback always, which is the expensive outcome this whole section
exists to avoid. Print a line on every path: an empty result must
never be how you conclude the check passed.

If `RUN_FALLBACK` is `0`, do not run the fallback, treat 7b as
finished, and go to 7c with this in the commit message:

> Note: pre-commit hooks were not run. `pre-commit` could not
> complete (infrastructure failure), and the remaining time budget
> was below the floor for running the hooks directly.

That skips `repo: local` hooks too, deliberately: a local `entry` can
fetch on its own (`uvx`, `pip`), so it is not reliably the cheap case,
and 7c's mandatory lint run still happens below the floor.

Skipping this way consumes neither of your two runs and does not hand
them back — 7b is closed for this validation-loop iteration either
way. A retry is a new iteration with a fresh budget; that is what lets
it fix a `pre-commit-blocked` failure.

If `RUN_FALLBACK` is `1`, run the fallback as described above.

**7c. Tests and linters — MANDATORY**

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP 7c: Tests and linters"
```

Run the test suite covering the code you changed:

```bash
make test        # or: go test ./..., npm test, pytest, etc.
make lint        # or: golangci-lint run, eslint, ruff, etc.
```

If tests fail due to your code:
1. Read the failure output carefully.
2. Fix the issue.
3. Re-run secret scan (7a) and then tests (7c).
4. Do NOT re-run pre-commit during 7c retries — your pre-commit budget
   for this validation-loop iteration is closed whether you spent it or
   skipped it. A validation-loop retry is a new iteration with a new
   budget. This is unrelated to `FIX_ITERATION`, which counts the
   review→fix loop.

The retry limit is read from `MAX_RETRIES` (default: 1).

**7d. Self-review**

```bash
git diff
```

Read every line. Check for:
- Changes that don't trace to a review comment
  <!-- skillsaw-disable-next-line content-placeholder-text -->
- Debug prints, commented-out code, TODO comments
- Secret material
- Protected-path files

### 8. Commit

```bash
echo "::notice::STEP 8: Commit"
```

**8a. Stage files**

```bash
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
```

Only include files you deliberately modified.

**8b. Scan staged content**

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
scan-secrets --staged
```

**NEVER use `git commit -s` or add `Signed-off-by` trailers.** DCO is a
human attestation of personhood and legal authority to contribute — agents
are not people. The DCO app already waives the check for bot authors, so
the trailer is unnecessary. Including it causes gitlint
`body-max-line-length` failures because the bot noreply email makes the
trailer ~90 characters.

**8c. Commit**

The commit message must:
- Follow the repo's commit convention (discovered in step 3).
- Reference the PR number and summarize what was fixed.
- Note any disagreements with review feedback.

```bash
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback on PR #${PR_NUMBER}

<summary of changes per review comment>

Addresses review feedback on #${PR_NUMBER}"
```

Validate with gitlint if available:

```bash
which gitlint &>/dev/null && gitlint --commit HEAD
```

### 9. Produce structured output

**This step is MANDATORY.** The post-script cannot function without it.

Write a JSON file to `$FULLSEND_OUTPUT_DIR/agent-result.json`:

```json
{
  "pr_number": 42,
  "trigger_source": "bot",
  "iteration": 1,
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "fix",
      "finding": "missing nil check in HandleRequest",
      "path": "pkg/handler.go",
      "description": "Added nil check for request parameter as requested"
    },
    {
      "type": "disagree",
      "finding": "refactor HandleRequest to use strategy pattern",
      "path": "pkg/handler.go",
      "reason": "The suggested refactor is out of scope for this PR and would change the public API"
    }
  ],
  "decision_points": [
    {
      "description": "Chose to use error wrapping instead of a new error type",
      "alternatives": ["Custom error type", "Sentinel error"],
      "rationale": "Matches existing error handling pattern in this package"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Addressed 2 of 3 review findings. Disagreed with 1 (out-of-scope refactor).",
  "strategy_change": null,
  "tests_passed": true,
  "files_changed": ["pkg/handler.go", "pkg/handler_test.go"]
}
```

**Schema compliance — read carefully.** The schema uses
`additionalProperties: false` at both the top level and inside each action
object. Any extra fields you invent will cause validation to fail. Only use
the fields shown in this section.

**`trigger_source` field:** Use the **normalized trigger type** you derived
in step 1 — `"bot"` or `"human"` — not the raw `TRIGGER_SOURCE` environment
variable value (the forge username). The schema enforces an enum of
`["bot", "human"]`; any other value fails validation.

**Action types:**

- `fix` — You fixed the code per the reviewer's feedback. **Required fields
  for fix actions:** `type`, `finding`, `description`. The post-script
  includes this in the summary comment.
- `disagree` — You determined the feedback is incorrect or out of scope.
  **Required fields for disagree actions:** `type`, `finding`, `reason`.
  The post-script includes your reason in the summary. The reviewer can
  insist in the next review cycle.

**Required top-level fields:** `pr_number`, `trigger_source`, `actions`,
`summary`, `tests_passed`, `files_changed`. The `actions` array must
contain at least one item.

Write the file using `Bash`:

```bash
cat > "${FULLSEND_OUTPUT_DIR}/agent-result.json" << 'FIXEOF'
{ ... your JSON ... }
FIXEOF
```

Validate the output against the schema:

```bash
fullsend-check-output "${FULLSEND_OUTPUT_DIR}/agent-result.json"
```

If validation fails, read the error output, fix the JSON file, and
re-run the check. If it still fails after 3 attempts, write the best
JSON you have and exit.

## Partial work

If you hit a token limit before addressing all findings: commit what
you have and produce structured output documenting which findings were
addressed and which remain. The post-script will communicate this to the
reviewer, and the next fix iteration will pick up the remaining items.

## Constraints

The agent definition (`agents/fix.md`) is the authoritative list of
prohibitions. This skill does not restate them. If a step in this skill
appears to conflict with the agent definition, the agent definition wins.
